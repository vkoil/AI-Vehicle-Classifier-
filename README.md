CIFAR-10:
 60,000 images overall, of which a total of 1,200 will be used for the system.
 10 Classes overall, of which two will be used. These classes are “automobiles” and “trucks”.
 Each class contains 6,000 images; however, we will only use 600 each from both classes.
 Out of the 600, 500 will be used for training, and 100 will be used for testing.
 Each image is coloured and has dimensions 32x32 pixels.
CIFAR-100:
